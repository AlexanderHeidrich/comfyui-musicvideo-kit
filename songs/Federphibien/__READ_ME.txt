FEDERPHIBIEN - 48 scenes over 171.4 s of song, 274.2 s of clip material (scenes overlap - trim in the edit)
==========================================================================

Every scene is one MiniMax H3 render. Files are paired by prefix:

  NN_title.mp3      the exact window of the song for that scene
  NN_title-v1.txt   wide master        }  same action, three cameras -
  NN_title-v2.txt   other angle        }  render two or three and cut
  NN_title-v3.txt   close / detail     }  between them inside the scene

The -vN.txt files are finished H3 prompts: MiniMax's six sections, no
markup, nothing to strip. Paste one in as the prompt exactly as it is.

  __SCENES.tsv      frame count, timing and pairing for every scene
  __batch/          line-aligned lists for batching in ComfyUI
  ALL_scenes.txt    the same material in this kit's DSL, which is what
                    the ComfyUI storyboard node reads for a batch run

Scenes that continue the shot before them:

  The screenplay holds one camera setup across these. Render them in
  order, export the LAST frame of the preceding clip, and load it as the
  first-frame reference for the next - that is what keeps the drawing from
  changing mid-setup while there are no character references.

  12_back-to-the-frog   <- last frame of 11_the-hen-turns-away
  29_she-walks-straight-past   <- last frame of 28_she-swallows-it
  31_cartoon-hearts   <- last frame of 30_her-walk
  35_she-pecks-him   <- last frame of 34_she-stoops-down

Scenes that must end on the frame they started on (the screenplay
marks them First Frame <> Last Frame): 11, 14, 24, 31, 35, 47


COMPOSITING - assembled in the edit, not rendered in

  16_hopping-through-the-grass  [loop]
        the open upper half is where scenes 15, 17 and 18 are placed
        the screenplay's endlose Loop: butt-join the clip to itself to
        hold the hop for as long as the visions need
  14_in-love-with-a-chicken  [plate]
        upper left of the sky, half transparent: the hen seen in profile
        the screenplay says oben links. No clip is generated for it - the
        profile on refs/03_char_das-huhn.png is the element, held as a
        still.
  15_imagine-our-children  [inset] -> over 16
        into the open sky in the upper half of scene 16, half transparent
        one of the three Zukunftsvisionen - the hen crocheting while three
        Federphibien play
  17_slimy-feathers  [inset] -> over 16
        into the open sky in the upper half of scene 16, half transparent
        one of the three Zukunftsvisionen - the slime-soaked feathers
  18_great-big-eyes  [inset] -> over 16
        into the open sky in the upper half of scene 16, half transparent
        one of the three Zukunftsvisionen - the huge eyes
  47_the-final-freeze  [freeze]
        hold the last frame as long as you like, then close the iris in
        Resolve - the screenplay asks for the effect there, so it is not
        rendered in

  A plate is rendered with its overlay area left empty on purpose.
  An inset is a full-frame clip of its own - place, scale and fade it
  in the edit. Nothing here is burned into a render.


Set length to the frame count in __SCENES.tsv - H3 only accepts lengths
where frames %% 17 == 5, and it rounds up, so do not retype it by feel.

Do not edit these files - they are regenerated. Edit _source/ and re-run
`mvkit build Federphibien`.
